""" Dynamic programming is a computer programming technique 
where an algorithmic problem is first broken down into sub-problems, 
the results are saved, 
and then the sub-problems are optimized to find the overall solution 
â€” which usually has to do with finding the maximum and minimum range of the algorithmic query """


# At the moment your house is 100 square meters. 
# The area that your things occupy is 50 square meters. 
# Your new apartment is 40 square meters 
# and you want your stuff to occupy 20 square meters at most.
total_area = 2000
# Your goal is to maximize the value on the 20 square meters.

# Step 1. Create a dictionary with items and area/value they contain.
# Step 2. Create area and value lists from the dictionary.
# Step 3. Use these lists to build the memoization table.
# Step 4. Get the items included in the last row of the memoization table.


# List your items specifying the area (in square decimeters) 
# and also the value items add to your life (on a scale from 0 to 100).
